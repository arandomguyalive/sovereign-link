# GHOST_OS: GLOBAL SURVEILLANCE & SIGINT SIMULATION

## Executive Summary & Exclusivity Analysis
GHOST_OS is a high-fidelity, geospatial tactical simulation designed for elite offensive security and intelligence gathering simulations. It provides a "God-Eye" view of the global metropolitan landscape, utilizing real-world geospatial data and advanced 3D rendering.

### Exclusive Features:
- **Prometheus 3D Engine:** Real-time rendering of global digital twins (Dubai, NYC, London, NEOM) with high-density architectural wireframes.
- **Sentinel Surveillance:** Ultra-stable tactical camera feeds with signal-recovery protocols and cinema-grade filters.
- **Neural-Grid SIGINT:** Real-time interception of mobile device signatures (IMEI, MAC, Vendor) from animated Lidar-track agents.
- **Orbital Command Interface:** Photorealistic planetary entry sequence with real-time satellite orbital mechanics.
- **Kill-Chain Hacking:** Terminal-based breach protocols integrated directly with 3D geospatial targets.
- **Cross-Platform Tactical Suite:** Fully optimized for high-DPI touch and desktop devices with unified pointer-lock interactivity.

## Comprehensive Project Log (Chronological)

### Phase 1: Inception & Scaffolding (Feb 10, 2026)
- Initialized Next.js project with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript.
- Established "GhostShell" visual language (Cyan Neon, Obsidian Gold).
- Implemented Virtual File System (VFS) and Terminal Core store.

### Phase 2: Core Desktop & Window Management
- Developed a custom Window Manager supporting drag, resize, maximize, and minimize.
- Fixed critical interaction issues related to pointer events and z-index layering.
- Implemented a cinematic "Neural-Link" boot sequence.

### Phase 3: Sentinel Surveillance
- Built the Camera Feed module with verified YouTube embeds and high-bandwidth CDN video loops.
- Implemented tactical overlays (REC indicators, IP/Protocol diagnostic data).
- Added "Signal Loss" fallback logic for maximum reliability.

### Phase 4: Geospatial Reconstruction (Dubai Grid)
- Rebuilt Dubai with accurate coastline mapping and mathematical Palm Jumeirah extrusion.
- Modeled Burj Khalifa (828m scale) and Burj Al Arab (Sail geometry).
- Implemented high-speed traffic light trails along metropolitan arteries.

### Phase 5: Global Overwatch (Orbital Hub)
- Developed a photorealistic 3D Earth engine with NASA textures and volumetric clouds.
- Implemented real-time orbiting satellites (KH-11, Sentinel-6, etc.) as tactical gateways.
- Expanded sectors to include New York City, Abu Dhabi, London, and NEOM.

### Phase 6: Deep Scan & SIGINT Integration
- Integrated real-time "Lidar" agents (thermal humanoid wireframes) patrolling the grid.
- Developed the "Deep Scan Dossier" panel for detailed device fingerprinting (MAC, IMEI, OS).
- Coupled the map interaction with terminal `breach` commands for "Kill-Chain" progression.

### Phase 7: Mobile & Tactical Optimization
- Migrated all interaction logic to universal Pointer Events.
- Optimized 3D MapControls for mobile gestures (pinch-to-zoom, pan).
- Hardened the architecture to eliminate React hydration errors (#418) and memory leaks.

*Status: GHOST_OS v25.4 - TARGET LOCK: ABHED ZONE 154.*

### Phase 10: Tactical Precision Update (Feb 11, 2026)
- **VIP Target Designation:** Added explicit 154th Floor (Abhed Zone) indicator to Burj Khalifa with gold-standard emissive highlighting.
- **Sector Access:** Enabled full interactivity for Palm Jumeirah District (Sector 09) with hit-box optimization.
- **Zone Markers:** Deployed tactical floating labels for Downtown, Marina, and Deira sectors to improve geospatial orientation.
- **UI Hardening:** Fixed click-through issues on complex wireframe geometry.
